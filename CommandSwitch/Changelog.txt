v3.0.1 (July 29, 2018)
	- Fixed the Addon actually working (Updated .toc, oops)
	- Added Debug to see where stuff can go wrong if it does.

	- Expanded to include switching for .go move (allows '.go move 5 forward').
	- Expanded to include switching for .go copy (allows '.go copy 5 forward').
	- Returns use of command ".go look" as a second version of ".look ob", similar to how it worked in previous versions of Enteleai and other servers.
